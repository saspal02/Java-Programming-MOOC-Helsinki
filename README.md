 ## Note
I decided to skip Parts 13 and 14 because they delve into Java FX, which focuses on desktop applications, and it's not where my interests lie.

As someone who's more inclined towards the backend route, I'm prioritizing my learning towards technologies and frameworks that align with that path. While I understand the importance and versatility of Java FX, it's just not something I see myself utilizing in my career trajectory.
